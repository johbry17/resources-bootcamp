    <h1>Hello, lovely people! and welcome to the 90's Netscape internet</h1>
    <p>Friends and family, I miss your faces! And we have a group project!</p>

    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Get a pretty little business card with a QR code that links to my portfolio website, and I haven’t built the portfolio yet (that's my problem and current task). The idea is to have the portfolio website host projects like <a href="https://johbry17.github.io/15-earthquakes-leaflet-javascript/">this USGS Earthquake map</a> and <a href="https://johbry17.github.io/14-belly-button-biodiversity-plotly-javascript/">this belly button biome dashboard</a> (but more complicated than those). I really should build three of them in the next month.</p>

    <h3>I could use help with this:</h3>

    <blockquote>

        <h4>Coming up with a professional email name</h4>
            <p>Just gotta make one up, something better than <a href="mailto:johbry17@gmail.com">johbry17@gmail.com</a>. It's kinda hard to come up with a memorable one when I have a blandly common white guy name like Bryan Johns</p>
        <h4>Business cards</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Anybody good at graphic design? I figure I’ll do something simple (name, email, profession, white background) unless anybody has brilliant ideas</li>
                <li>Any recommendation for a QR code generator?</li>
                <li>Recommendation for a company that prints business cards that actually scan a QR code?</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Portfolio website</h4>
        <p>Any recommendations? I am paying a modest amount of money to do this. I have no time, it needs to look damn good, and I need to mess with it frequently, so I need an automatic website designer and host.</p>
