    <h1>Hello, lovely people!</h1>
    <p>Friends and family, near and far in time and space, we have a group project!</p>

    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Get a pretty little business card with a QR code that links to my portfolio website, and I haven’t built the portfolio (my problem).</p>

    <h3>I could use help with this:</h3>

    <blockquote>

        <h4>Coming up with a professional email name</h4>
            <p>Just gotta make one up, something better than <a href="mailto:johbry17@gmail.com">johbry17@gmail.com</a>. It's kinda hard to come up with a memorable one when I have a blandly common white guy name like Bryan Johns - might as well be John Smith)</p>
        <h4>Business cards</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Anybody good at graphic design? I figure I’ll do something simple (name, email, profession, white background) unless anybody has brilliant ideas</li>
                <li>Any recommendation for a QR code generator?</li>
                <li>Recommendation for a company that prints business cards that actually scan a QR code?</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Portfolio website</h4>
        <p>Any recommendations? I am paying a modest amount of money to do this. I have no time, it needs to look damn good, and I need to mess with it frequently, so I need an automatic website designer and host.</p>

        <h4>Tech people! I could use help with designing two Harvard projects. Just talking out the pseudocode and planning it.</h4>
        <p><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/project/">cs50 final project</a> - Use flask to host a website that shows annual Harvest Party data, accompanied by a jupyter notebook exploratory data analysis. The data is stored in a chaotic google sheet, so I’m gonna have to copy it to a new sheet and clean it a bit (need to change the names of people and build categories for spending). Export the data to a csv(s). Import and clean said csv(s) and combine the data further in a jupyter notebook. Use matplotlib and pandas to create useful graphs that might actually help us save some money on future harvest parties. Export the data from the jupyter notebook. Build a website that looks kind of like this (<a href="https://johbry17.github.io/14-belly-button-biodiversity-plotly-javascript/">example</a>) with fun charts and plots that vary by year.</p>
        <p><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/project/">Python final project</a> - Gonna be a program that creates one of my famously overly detailed travel budgets. I need at least three sub functions with three Unit Tests. Shouldn’t be too hard. Also a low priority.</p>

        <h4>Non Tech People! Don't worry about it, but see this <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/9/finance/">project</a> for some idea of what goes into a full-stack project.</h4>

    <h3>Timeline:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Portfolio website - chosen and paid for and rough drafted before October 4</li>
        <li>Professional email - before October 4</li>
        <li>Business cards - designed by October 4th-ish for order (so I can make sure they scan and reorder if necessary)</li>
        <li>Massive bootcamp project due October 10</li>
        <li>cs50 final project done by October 21, as it’s Harvest Party related</li>
        <li>cs50python as soon as possible</li>
        <li><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/9/finance/">cs50 penultimate project</a> as soon as possible (which I’m just chipping away at as practice for the next bootcamp project and cs50 final project)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>School update:</h3>
    <p>I have three projects going on right now.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bootcamp, which is unrelenting. About to start our first full-stack group project this week. I spent $12,500 to spend a 6 month sabbatical solving puzzles so I could get a better quality of life. It’s crunch time.</li>
        <li>Career material prep. This is building the portfolio website and the business card, CV, LinkedIn, github, “brand” statement, etc.</li>
        <li>The Harvard stuff covers foundational computer science concepts. It’s lower-level stuff that helps me do the data visualization and analysis better. It’s optional, but I want it. I have come so far in both classes this year (300-400 hours each, maybe more), and it would be a shame to quit before the finish line. cs50python is done, except for the final project, and cs50 is done except for the penultimate project (my first full-stack project, perfect timing with my bootcamp where we’re about to do… a full-stack group project) and the final project (a full-stack project with a bit of exploratory data analysis that I hope to time with Harvest Party).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why do this optional Harvard stuff? First, it made me a much better programmer by the time I started bootcamp. I finished about half of both courses before I started bootcamp, and I’ve been chipping away at them as bootcamp rolled along. The shitty thing is, I can’t show off any of my work for either course publicly, as it violates their policy (putting the answers on the internet and all), so I really should get those final projects done. Plus, then I can use my portfolio to talk about the $5,000 annual event that I throw with a dedicated team (Harvest Party) or my OCD in travel planning, and I need stories for job interviews that are not bar related.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this is where I’m at. I have officially been educated by seven institutes of higher education.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bachelor’s:
            <ul>
                <li>UVM dropout</li>
                <li>finished at Evergreen</li>
                <li>on a University of Minnesota study abroad in India</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Master’s:
            <ul>
                <li>American University in Washington DC,</li>
                <li>United Nations University for Peace in Costa Rica</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Analytics training:
            <ul>
                <li>George Washington University</li>
                <li>Harvard</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That’s right, bitches. I am Harvard-educated. Hah!</p>
