    <h1>Hello, lovely people! and welcome to the 90's Netscape internet</h1>
    <p>Friends and family near and far in time and space, I miss your faces! And we have a group project!</p>

    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Get a pretty little business card with a QR code that links to my portfolio website, and I haven’t built the portfolio yet (that's my problem and current task).</p>

    <h3>I could use help with this:</h3>

    <blockquote>

        <h4>Coming up with a professional email name</h4>
            <p>Just gotta make one up, something better than <a href="mailto:johbry17@gmail.com">johbry17@gmail.com</a>. It's kinda hard to come up with a memorable one when I have a blandly common white guy name like Bryan Johns</p>
        <h4>Business cards</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Anybody good at graphic design? I figure I’ll do something simple (name, email, profession, white background) unless anybody has brilliant ideas</li>
                <li>Any recommendation for a QR code generator?</li>
                <li>Recommendation for a company that prints business cards that actually scan a QR code?</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Portfolio website</h4>
        <p>Any recommendations? I am paying a modest amount of money to do this. I have no time, it needs to look damn good, and I need to mess with it frequently, so I need an automatic website designer and host.</p>

        <h4>Tech people! I could use help with designing two Harvard projects. Just talking out the pseudocode and planning it.</h4>
        <p><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/project/">cs50 final project</a> - Use flask to host a website that shows annual Harvest Party data, accompanied by a jupyter notebook exploratory data analysis. The data is stored in a chaotic google sheet, so I’m gonna have to copy it to a new sheet and clean it a bit (need to assign pseudonyms and build categories for spending). Export the data to a csv(s). Import and clean said csv(s) and combine the data further in a jupyter notebook. Use matplotlib and pandas to create useful graphs that might actually help us save some money on future harvest parties. Export the data from the jupyter notebook. Build a website that looks kind of like this (<a href="https://johbry17.github.io/14-belly-button-biodiversity-plotly-javascript/">example</a>) with fun charts and plots that vary by year. Could easily expand website from there: photo gallery, about page, link to the Oregon Trail online...</p>
        <p><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/project/">Python final project</a> - Gonna be a program that creates one of my famously overly detailed travel budgets. I need at least three sub functions with three Unit Tests. Shouldn’t be too hard. Also a low priority.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <h3>Timeline:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Portfolio website - chosen and paid for and rough drafted before October 4</li>
        <li>Professional email - before October 4</li>
        <li>Business cards - designed by October 4th-ish for order (so I can make sure they scan and reorder if necessary)</li>
        <li>Massive bootcamp project due October 10</li>
        <li>cs50 final project done by October 21, as it’s Harvest Party related</li>
        <li>cs50python as soon as possible</li>
        <li><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/9/finance/">cs50 penultimate project</a> as soon as possible (which I’m just chipping away at as practice for the next bootcamp project and cs50 final project)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>School update:</h3>
    <p>I have three projects going on right now.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bootcamp, which is unrelenting. About to start our first full-stack group project this week. I spent $12,500 to spend a 6 month sabbatical solving puzzles so I could get a better quality of life. It’s crunch time.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Career material prep. This is building the portfolio website and the business card, CV, LinkedIn, github, “brand” statement, etc.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The Harvard stuff covers foundational computer science concepts. It’s lower-level stuff that helps me do the data visualization and analysis better. It’s optional, but I want it. I have come so far in both classes this year (300-400 hours each?), and it would be a shame to quit at the 24th mile of a marathon. The shitty thing is, I can’t show off any of my work for either course publicly, as it violates their policy (putting the answers on the internet and all), so I really should get those final projects done (those CAN be publicly shared). cs50python is done, except for the final project (travel planner), and cs50 is done except for the penultimate project (fake stock trading, my first full-stack project, perfect timing with my bootcamp where we’re about to do… a full-stack group project) and the final project (a full-stack project with a bit of exploratory data analysis that I hope to time with Harvest Party). Slap that stuff into the above portfolio website and CV, and we have great non-restaurant stories to tell in job interviews about somebody (me) who is far more loveable than I actually am. Have I told you about the $3,000/year event I throw with a dedicated team (Harvest Party), or the trips that I plan for people to places like the Virgin Islands and Machu Picchu? I used my cs50python website to plan a trip for my BTS-loving cousin to Korea, and my hobbit-loving cousin to New Zealand (hearts melt, job acquired).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the nerds: With cs50, I started by learning C, basically the grandpa language of modern-day computer languages. It's like learning Latin, not Proto-Indo-European.  I made things like Ninetendo Mario Bros. blocks, a Julius Casear cypher, the Luntz algorithm to check credit card number validity, and simulated elections, ending with extracting photos from a raw file and building a hash table as a spell-checker. Then, I switched to cs50python. More fundamentals (functions, nested loops, variables, file I/O). Much more 'software engineer' oriented. Big focus on reading the documentation and unit tests, with a bit of regular expressions and object-oriented programming.</p>
        
    <p>I only got through week 4 of cs50 and week 6 of cs50python before bootcamp started. Since then, I have slowly chipped away at the rest of those courses as bootcamp rolled along. In bootcamp, we ran through Excel and VBA quickly, before switching to python (the world's second most common programming langauge), pandas (makes pretty tables from data), matplotlib (makes pretty charts from data), APIs, SQL (database), noSQL (also database), Flask (hosts a website), beautiful soup (web scraping), JavaScript (the world's most common programming language), Plotly (makes charts), and Leaflet (makes maps). Now I do a big full-stack group project, followed by Tableau, and finishing with AI (supervised and unsupervised machine learning, neural networks, big data) and a final portfolito project (TBD).</p>

    <p>Anyway, this is where I’m at. I have officially been educated by seven institutes of higher education.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bachelor’s:
            <ul>
                <li>UVM dropout</li>
                <li>finished at Evergreen</li>
                <li>on a University of Minnesota study abroad in India</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Master’s (two-for-one sale!):
            <ul>
                <li>American University in Washington DC,</li>
                <li>United Nations University for Peace in Costa Rica</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Analytics training:
            <ul>
                <li>George Washington University</li>
                <li>Harvard</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That’s right, bitches! I am a Harvard-educated Reverend. Hah!</p>
